Well-\/defined and extensible event model is a must for an event-\/driven application. JUMP Framework does have a well-\/defined event model focused on I$|$O. It also allows you to implement your own event type without breaking the existing code at all because each event type is distinguished from each other by strict type hierarchy. 

A \hyperlink{a00023}{JPPipelineEvent} is handled by a list of \hyperlink{a00029}{JPPipelineHandler} in a \hyperlink{a00019}{JPPipeline}. \hyperlink{a00001}{The Pipeline} implements an advanced form of the \href{http://java.sun.com/blueprints/corej2eepatterns/Patterns/InterceptingFilter.html}{\tt Intercepting Filter} pattern to give a user full control over how an event is handled and how the handlers in the pipeline interact with each other. For example, you can define what to do when a data is readed: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
 @interface MyReadHandler : JPSimplePipelineHandler {}
 @end
 
 @implementation MyReadHandler
 
 -(void)messageReceived:(<JPPipelineHandlerContext>)ctx withMessageEvent:(<
      JPPipelineMessageEvent>)e {
          id message = [e getMessage];
          // Do something with the received message.
          ...
          
          // And forward the event to the next handler.
          [ctx sendUpstream:e];
 }
 @end
\end{DoxyCode}
 You can also define what to do when other handler requested a write operation: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
 @interface MyWriteHandler : JPSimplePipelineHandler {}
 @end
 
 @implementation MyWriteHandler
 
 -(void)writeRequested:(<JPPipelineHandlerContext>)ctx withMessageEvent:(<
      JPPipelineMessageEvent>)e {
          id message = [e getMessage];
          // Do something with the message to be written.
          ...
          
          // And forward the event to the next handler.
          [ctx sendDownstream:e];
 }
 @end
\end{DoxyCode}
