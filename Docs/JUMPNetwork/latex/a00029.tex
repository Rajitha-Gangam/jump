\subsection{Detailed Description}
Handles or intercepts a Event, and sends a Event to the next handler in a Pipeline. Pipeline Handler Protocol itself does not provide any method. To handle a Event you need to implement its sub-\/interfaces. There are two sub-\/interfaces which handles a received event, one for upstream events and the other for downstream events:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{a00035}{JPPipelineUpstreamHandler} handles and intercepts an upstream Event.
\item \hyperlink{a00021}{JPPipelineDownstreamHandler} handles and intercepts a downstream Event.
\end{DoxyItemize}

You will also find more detailed explanation from the documentation of each sub-\/interface on how an event is interpreted when it goes upstream and downstream respectively.

\paragraph*{The context object}

A \hyperlink{a00029}{JPPipelineHandler} is provided with a \hyperlink{a00030}{JPPipelineHandlerContext} object. A \hyperlink{a00029}{JPPipelineHandler} is supposed to interact with the \hyperlink{a00019}{JPPipeline} it belongs to via a context object. Using the context object, the \hyperlink{a00029}{JPPipelineHandler} can pass events upstream or downstream, modify the pipeline dynamically, or store the information (attachment) which is specific to the handler. 

The documentation for this protocol was generated from the following file:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
